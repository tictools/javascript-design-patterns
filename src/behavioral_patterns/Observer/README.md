# Observer pattern

## Description

We have to create an application for a weather station. From different points of a city we will receive data in real time through a Socket from the different Humidity and Temperature devices.

The data will be shown on two different displays, one for humidity and one for temperature.

Design and implement the system. To simulate the data in real time you can create an entity that generates new data every second with `setInterval`, pretending to be the socket

Humidity is measured in % and temperature in ÂºC
