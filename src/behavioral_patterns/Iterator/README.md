# Description

We have an application in which there is a list of person objects whose properties are:

- name
- surname
- age
- childrens [number of children]).

In the application we can ORDER the list

- by name (ascending and descending alphabetical)
- by age (ascending and descending)
- by number of children (ascending and descending).

In addition, we can associate both a button and a shortcut with ordering (invent the shortcut).

Perform the deployment in several ways:

- Entirely with classes without caring that we are in JS
- Using JS with generator functions
- Using Symbol.iterator

There are two patterns to implement in the exercise
